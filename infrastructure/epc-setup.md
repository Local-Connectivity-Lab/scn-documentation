# CoLTE/EPC Setup

Our core networks use the [CoLTE project](https://github.com/uw-ictd/colte) maintained by the [UW ICTD Lab](https://ictd.cs.washington.edu/).

For information on how to install and configure CoLTE, visit the [tutorial](https://docs.colte.network/tutorials/epc-setup.html) we wrote with them!
