# SCN Docs
This repository contains the contents of the [Seattle Community Network Docs](https://dominickta.github.io/scn-documentation/). It is intended to provide interested community members a guidebook on how to get involved in the community and learn.

To learn how to contribute to these docs, visit our documentation on that [here](https://dominickta.github.io/scn-documentation/contribute.html).
