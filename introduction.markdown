# Introduction
[Seattle Community Cellular Network](https://seattlecommunitynetwork.org/) is a community network. This means that city residents take it upon themselves to maintain and grow the network. A massive amount of cooperation between many different people with many different skills is required to accomplish this, and this website is here to make sure that individuals who want to improve the network can get the knowledge and skills they need to do so. (this is plagiarized from NYC Mesh).
## Who Should Read This Website
This website contains information about the technical implementation of the Seattle Community Cellular Network itself. Before reading this website, please read our FAQ. Many common questions are answered there, and this documentation is mostly written with the assumption that readers are already familiar with the answers to our most frequently asked questions.

Once you have already read our FAQ, then you should consider reading or referring to this website if:

* you want to help expand the network by physically installing new nodes,
* you have computer networking experience and want to help improve the networkâ€™s performance or security,
* you plan to volunteer to monitor or otherwise maintain the network and have questions regarding the configuration of various hardware and software components, or
* you are interested in knowing details about how NYC Mesh functions that are not already covered by the FAQ.

We are always excited to welcome new volunteers who want to help us continue providing affordable, fair, and fast Internet connectivity to our fair city and so we hope you find this guidebook useful.
