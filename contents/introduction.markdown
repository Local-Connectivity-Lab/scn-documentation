# Documentation
Hello and welcome to the documentation website for [Seattle Community Cellular Network](https://seattlecommunitynetwork.org/)! 
## About Seattle Community Cellular Network
We are a community network dedicated to providing fair access to underserved communities all across the Puget Sound. SCCN is a 501(c)(3) registered non-profit in partnership with the University of Washington (UW) that shares free or low-cost broadband access in higher-need areas throughout the city, making use of existing UW and city network infrastructure such as buildings and fiber-optic cables to extend coverage to more people.

As a community network, we rely on the help of city residents such as yourself to maintain and grow the network. Joining us is a great way to become an active member of your own community, make friends, as well as learn valuable technical skills. Ask questions in our [Slack chat](https://join.slack.com/t/seattlecommunitynet/shared_invite/zt-kdm2ow00-QXhuqWHpFLTAiLmJN4IIgQ) and connect with our other volunteers or [join our mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/seattlecommunitynetwork.org/g/local-connectivity-lab/).
## About This Website
The SCCN Docs website is the central hub for technical information about our network. Here, we describe the implementation of specific nodes, document installation procedures, and more. Readers are expected to have some basic familiarity with computer networking concepts in order to fully understand the material we cover, but we do try our best to provide links to good educational resources for new volunteers.

This website itself is maintained by our volunteers, much like the rest of our services. That means you can help us improve it by adding missing information, clarifying confusing points, or even just fixing typos you notice while youâ€™re reading. See our [docs README file](https://github.com/anisa-su/sccn-documentation/blob/gh-pages/README.md) to learn more about how you can contribute to this website.
