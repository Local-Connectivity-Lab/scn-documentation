# Get Started
Lost? You're in the right place!

Seattle Community Network has a place for **everyone**. Whether you'd like to join
to get free Internet, get involved to help out your community, learn some skills
so that you can get a job, or all of the above!

This document serves to point you to a few places where you can integrate yourself into our
community, but ultimately it's up to you to meet people and stay connected!

**PRO TIP**{: .label .label-green} Do everything on this page! Our community is spread out in a lot of different places, so doing everything is the best way to get connected.

## Join our Slack!
If you've never heard of Slack before, it's an instant messaging platform that we use to stay in touch
with each other, organize our different teams, and update everyone on last minute things.

This is a MUST do if you don't want to get left out!

### Follow these steps to get the best Slack community experience

1. [Create a Slack account](https://slack.com/get-started#/create) if you don't have one already
2. [Install Slack](https://slack.com/downloads/) on your computer and phone to always stay up-to-date.
3. [Join our Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/seattlecommunitynet/shared_invite/zt-kdm2ow00-QXhuqWHpFLTAiLmJN4IIgQ)
4. Important! Join _all_ of the channels that you might be interested in. By default you will only have access to a few, but there are actually a dozen hidden channels that conversations are happening in!
	- To join channels on the computer application, go to the left-hand sidebar and scroll down until you see "Add channels"
	- Click "Browse channels" and click "Join" on any channel that interests you. Repeat this step to add more channels.
5. Introduce yourself in the `#introductions` channel! Some things you might want to include are how you heard about SCN and what got you interested in it!

**PRO TIP**{: .label .label-green } Add as many channels as possible! You can always leave a channel or put it on mute later.

## Chat with someone!
The best way to get involved with the network is to find someone that can direct you!

This could look like...
- joining a channel and asking for an update on what's going on
- chatting with a [team leader]( {{ "community/teams.html" | absolute_url }} ) (over Zoom or Slack) about how you might be able to help
- attending a virtual/in-person meeting (e.g. monthly community meeting, regular team meeting, etc.)

## Subscribe to our Google calendar!
On our Google calendar we post regular occurring meetings and any impromptu events like social events, emergency repairs, site visits, etc.
This is one of the only places to find out about the meetings our various teams are having!
